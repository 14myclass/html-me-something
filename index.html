            <p>I had the pleasure of volunteering in the Peace Corps
            where I spent 2 years teaching secondary education in Western Samoa (Samoa).

                <p>Samoa is an independent country nestled in the South Pacific Ocean. This Polynesian</p><p>country
                is made up of several islands. I lived on Upoulu which is the main island.</p>

            <p>I was a science and math highschool teacher at Avele College. The kids there were the same as in the States.They enjoyed hanging with friends and being "cheeky."</p>
            <p>In each government (public) school, the students wore uniforms and the teachers wore formal dressing: a "puletasi" for women and an "ie"for men.</p>

            <p>When I was not teaching, I visited my host family and helped out with chores like clearing the rubbish, playing with the little kids, and prepping food to be cooked in an "umu" outside in the "fale kuka."</p>

            <p>My favorite was "falai mamoe" which is a mutton stir fry and "palusami" with "ulu" which is like creamed spinach and breadfruit.</p>
            
            <p>I went to church with my family and celebrated holidays like "lotu tamaiti" which is like Easter, Halloween, and Christmas all rolled up into one for kids...they would get tons of candy, gifts, and new clothes.</p>

            <p>I even learned to do a traditional siva samoa <iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iYOyoGtVRuM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe> since my host father was a "matai" which meant I was the "Taupou."</p>
            
            <p>I lived on the school grounds in a "fale palagi." When I visited my host family, we ate and lounged in a "fale o'o" which is a typical Samoan house without walls.</p>

            <p>Samoa has beautiful lush scenery and landscapes throughout the island. I<a href="http://www.samoa.travel/"> travelled</a> mostly by bike but occassionaly by bus.</p>

            <p>Everywhere I went, people were nice and inviting...that's the "Fa'asaamoa"-the Samoan way.</p>
            
            <p>I met my husband, Malele, in Samoa. We got married in Tepuke, New Zealand three years later and have two children: Afiya and Faaleatua.</p>

            <p> Even though I am no longer in Samoa, I carry it with me everyday. Being a Peace Corps Volunteer was one of the best experiences of my life.</p>
            <p> I highly recommend it!</p>
